# Kiro Usage

This project was developed as part of **Kiro Week 6 – The Referee** challenge.

Kiro was used to:
- Accelerate rapid iteration and prototyping
- Refine AI decision logic and prompt structure
- Validate comparison flows and trade-off analysis

Kiro helped reduce development friction and enabled faster experimentation while building the final solution.
