# The Referee – AI Decision Comparison Tool ⚖️🤖

The Referee is an AI-powered decision comparison tool built for the **Kiro Week 6 Challenge – The Referee** under the **AI for Bharat** program.

Instead of providing a single “best” answer, The Referee compares multiple valid options, clearly explaining trade-offs, risks, and suitability to help users make confident, informed decisions.

## Problem Statement

Most AI tools:
- Provide a single recommendation
- Hide trade-offs and risks
- Do not explain *why* one option is better than another

For decisions like selecting a tech stack, making career moves, hiring, or major purchases, this approach can lead to poor or biased outcomes. Users need transparent comparisons, not one-line answers.

---

## Solution: The Referee

The Referee approaches decision-making differently.

Instead of answering *“What should I choose?”*, it helps users understand:
- What options are available
- The pros and cons of each option
- The risks involved
- Which option best fits their priorities

This enables thoughtful, balanced decision-making.
